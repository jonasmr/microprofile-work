
This folder contains a few samples:

Some of it has dependencies:
SDL :
		On Windows: unzip SDL2 into sdl2 subfolder below demo/ and build it, before compiling the samples
		OSX/Linux: sdl2 should be compiled & installed, so that sdl2-config is available. 

vulkan:
	install vulkan sdk, and make sure VK_SDK_PATH is set


Note that demo_workbench uses instrumentation, which requires you to build distorm.
	build it using the files in distorm/make
